## 📌 Features  
✔️ **Animal Detection:** Uses PIR motion sensors & cameras to detect approaching animals.  
✔️ **AI Identification:** Recognizes animals using a trained ML model.  
✔️ **Automated Deterrents:** Activates ultrasonic sound, LED lights, and sprinklers.  
✔️ **IoT Alerts:** Sends notifications to the farmer’s mobile via Wi-Fi/GSM.  
✔️ **Solar Powered:** Uses renewable energy for sustainability.  
✔️ **Cloud Monitoring:** Logs intrusions for analysis.
